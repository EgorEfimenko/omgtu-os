# Multi-threaded simulated ring taxi
To develop for Windows-type OS a multi-program simulation of the operation of a circular route taxi with six stops. A fixed number N of potential passengers at a random time interval are somewhere off the route, then appear randomly at one of the stops. The taxi can accommodate no more than five (to simplify) passengers. If necessary, passengers crowd at the bus stop without forming a properly organized queue. Riding passengers randomly leave at one of the following stops, but do not drive in a circle, after which passengers again stay outside the route for a random interval, and then their actions are repeated as described above (at a stop, etc.). The program must take the value of the value of the number N from the numeric parameter specified in the command line of the program. The behavior of each passenger and taxi should be implemented in a separate thread. Use semaphores or mutexes for proper communication. Displaying the dynamics of the model should be carried out in the console window using conditional schemes, icons and texts, the size of the window is not less than 40 lines by 100 columns.
